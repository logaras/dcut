The following task should be implemented in D or C++, unless we've specifically
discussed with you that you should complete it in another language.

Implement a reduced functionality version of the linux command line tool cut
[1]. The following options should be present:

-b to output the specified bytes of each line from the file.
-f to output the specified delimited fields of each line from the file.
-d to specify the field delimiter (defaults to TAB if not specified).
--complement to invert the set of selected bytes / fields.

The application does not need to worry about handling multi-byte characters, and
only needs to be able to read from files - don't worry about reading from stdin.
